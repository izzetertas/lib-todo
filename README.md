[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/90ff98db996bb137c5be1bdce666c4b1ce68a25b17af0a6a04.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/harvey/react-component-library)

This project skeleton was created to help people get started with creating their own React component library using:

- [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

It also features:

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to help you create and show off your components
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) enabling testing of the components

## Development

### Testing

```
npm run test
```

### Building

```
npm run build
```

### Storybook

To run a live-reload Storybook server on your local machine:

```
npm run storybook
```

To export your Storybook as static files:

```
npm run storybook:export
```

You can then serve the files under `storybook-static` using S3, GitHub pages, Express etc. I've hosted this library at: https://www.harveydelaney.com/react-component-library


Component structure

```
/src
  /YourComponentName
    YourComponentName.tsx
    YourComponentName.stories.tsx
    YourComponentName.test.tsx
    YourComponentName.types.ts
    YourComponentName.scss
    index.ts
```

Don't forget to add the component to your `index.ts` exports if you want the library to export the component!

## Publishing

First, make sure you have an NPM account and are [logged into NPM using the `npm login` command.](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-a-new-npm-user-account)

Then update the `name` field in `package.json` to reflect your NPM package name in your private or public NPM registry. Then run:

```
npm publish
```

## Consuming


Usage of the component (after the library installed as a dependency into another project) will be:

```TSX
import React from "react";
import { TodoList } from "@izzetertas/lib-todo";

const items={[]}

const App = () => (
  <div className="app-container">
    <h1>Hello I'm consuming the component library</h1>
    <TodoList items={items} />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```
